Sub CONFIG()
'# Debug
'# Set this to change the behavior of the macro in case an error occures. (for DEBUG)
DebugHandler = 1 '# [0] just continue (ignore); [1] show warnings (notice); [2] show warning and also terminate macro execution (react) in case its a critical error (would probably else result in a vba crash)



'# Main Sheet Name
'# Use this variable to define the worksheet that is affected by the macro
'Set MainWS = Worksheets("Demo") '# Please enter one of your worksheets within the "" as reference ...
Set MainWS = Worksheets(ActiveSheet.Name) '# ... OR use Worksheets(ActiveSheet.Name) in case you want to always run the macro on the selected worksheet


'# Processed Rows
'# dimension of the table (=index of the last row); If set to '0' the macro will try to determine the last row of the element column (other columns may have different dimensions)
LastRow = 0 '# indicates the last row that will be processed by the macro
'# first processed row (for not processing the header or the buttons)
'StartingRow = 3 '# fix starting row ...
'# ... or start depending on worksheet name (or any other property)
    Select Case MainWS.Name
        Case "Demo" '# this is the worksheet with the buttons so the Starting row is incremented
            StartingRow = 3
        Case "any" '# any other worksheet you want to add exceptions for
            'StartingRow = 2

            StartingRow = 3 '# you may not have buttons in the second row but probably headers in the first
    End Select

'# Maximum Text Size in Shapes (is automatically reduced if letters would else be hidden)
FontSizeMax = 25 '# increase this value if you often use low Excel zoom levels and need to increase the text size inside the shapes


'# Processed Columns
